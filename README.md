# 🧠 Zustand State Management – Easy Guide for Beginners

This app uses **Zustand** for global state management. Zustand is a tiny and fast library that lets you manage state without prop drilling. This guide is meant for beginner developers — like a simple step-by-step learning notebook. 🎓

## 📁 Store File: `useMoodStore.ts`

This file creates your Zustand store.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type Entry = {
  id: number
  mood: string
  note: string
  affirmation: string
  date: string
}

type MoodState = {
  entries: Entry[]
  addEntry: (entry: Entry) => void
}

export const useMoodStore = create<MoodState>((set) => ({
  entries: [],
  addEntry: (entry) =>
    set((state) => ({
      entries: [...state.entries, entry],
    })),
}))


What this does:
Entry is a TypeScript type that defines what each mood log looks like.

MoodState describes the shape of our store: an array of entries and a function to add one.

create() creates the Zustand hook: useMoodStore.

Inside, entries starts as an empty array.

addEntry adds a new entry using the set() function.

set() is like writing into our global notebook.

📥 Using the Store in a Component
In EntryForm.tsx:
ts
Copy
Edit
const addEntry = useMoodStore((s) => s.addEntry)
This line gets the addEntry function from the store.

ts
Copy
Edit
addEntry(newEntry)
This line adds a new entry into the global state.

In EntryList.tsx:
ts
Copy
Edit
const entries = useMoodStore((s) => s.entries)
This gets all the saved entries from the store.

Whenever entries changes, the component re-renders automatically.

This is how Zustand helps different components share the same data easily.

🗂 Summary: What Each Part Does
Part	What it does
useMoodStore.ts	Creates the global state and functions to change it
create()	Makes the Zustand hook you can use anywhere
set()	Updates the global state inside the store
useMoodStore()	Hook you use in components to get or update data
(s) => s.thing	Function that picks the part of the store you want

🌀 Reusing Zustand in Other Apps
You can create a store for:

- A counter
- A todo list
- A dark/light theme
- Login state
- Shopping cart

Example: Counter Store
ts
Copy
Edit
type CounterState = {
  count: number
  increase: () => void
  reset: () => void
}

export const useCounterStore = create<CounterState>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increase: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  reset: () => set({ count: 0 }),
}))
Then in your component:
ts
Copy
Edit
const count = useCounterStore((s) => s.count)
const increase = useCounterStore((s) => s.increase)

return (
  <div>
    <p>{count}</p>
    <button onClick={increase}>Add 1</button>
  </div>
)
